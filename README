NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Util::Git::Refs - Work with refs

VERSION
    version 0.001000

SYNOPSIS
    After doing lots of work with Git::Wrapper, I found there's quite a few
    ways to work with refs, and those ways aren't exactly all equal, or
    supported on all versions of git.

    This abstracts it so things can just use them.

        my $refs = Dist::Zilla::Util::Git::Refs->new();

        $refs->refs(); # A ::Ref object for each entry from `git ls-remote .`

        my ( @results ) = $refs->get_ref('refs/**'); # the same thing

        my ( @results ) = $refs->get_ref('refs/heads/**'); # all branches

        my ( @results ) = $refs->get_ref('refs/tags/**'); # all tags

        my ( @results ) = $refs->get_ref('refs/remotes/**'); # all remote branches

    Note: You probably shouldn't use this module directly, and should
    instead use one of the "::Util::Git" family.
